ANS - üîç Understanding the Errors and Warnings in Your Expo Project Setup
Your installation of Expo completed successfully, but there are multiple warnings about deprecated packages. These aren't critical errors, but they indicate that some dependencies are outdated and might cause issues in the future.

üö® Key Issues in Your Error Log
Deprecated Packages
Many npm warnings (npm WARN deprecated) indicate that some dependencies are outdated and no longer supported.

Examples:
inflight@1.0.6 ‚Üí Leaks memory, suggested alternative: lru-cache
rimraf@2.6.3 and rimraf@3.0.2 ‚Üí Not supported, upgrade to rimraf v4
glob@7.2.3 ‚Üí Versions below v9 are no longer supported
sudo-prompt@9.1.1 ‚Üí No longer maintained
Babel Plugins (@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator, etc.) are now part of standard JavaScript, so they are no longer needed.


Security Vulnerabilities


5 low severity vulnerabilities
To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
npm audit fix --force
There are 5 low-severity security vulnerabilities.
These can be fixed using:

npm audit fix
If that doesn't work, try:

npm audit fix --force
(‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This may install breaking changes, so use with caution.)



‚úÖ How to Fix These Issues?
Update npm and Expo CLI
First, ensure your npm and Expo CLI are up to date:


npm install -g npm expo-cli
Upgrade Outdated Dependencies
Inside your Expo project folder (CourseApp), run:


npm outdated
This will show a list of outdated packages.
To upgrade them:

npm update
Manually Fix Specific Deprecated Packages

If npm update does not fix the deprecated packages, manually install newer versions:

npm install rimraf@latest glob@latest lru-cache@latest
Fix Security Vulnerabilities

Run:

npm audit fix
If needed, force fix with:

npm audit fix --force

----------------------------------------





üîç Understanding npm audit fix and npm audit fix --force
When you install packages using npm install, some of them may have security vulnerabilities. npm provides a built-in tool called npm audit to check for and fix these issues.


1Ô∏è‚É£ What is npm audit fix?

npm audit fix
This command automatically fixes security vulnerabilities by updating packages only if it won't break your project.
It updates minor and patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1 ‚Üí 1.0.2) but avoids major updates that could cause compatibility issues.
‚úÖ Safe to use because it won't upgrade breaking changes.


2Ô∏è‚É£ What is npm audit fix --force?

npm audit fix --force
This forces npm to fix all vulnerabilities, even if it means installing breaking changes.
It updates major versions (e.g., 1.0.1 ‚Üí 2.0.0), which can break your project if dependencies are not compatible.
‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution because it might make your app unstable or cause errors.
